                    ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m a Frontend developer passionate about creating clean, responsive, and user-centered interfaces.
                    
                    Iâ€™ve worked on several projects using React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI, including a travel website, a movie site, and a task management app. I also built a facial recognition system for personnel tracking, designed to be fully responsive.

                    As part of my graduation project, I developed a cross-platform mobile app for managing tennis tournaments using Flutter, Firebase, and SCRUM. I also designed apps for the Wilstermann Club and a livestock social network.

                    I value clean code, accessibility, and attention to detail. I'm always improving my skills, currently exploring tools like Zustand and refining my UI design with Tailwind and DaisyUI.

                    I enjoy collaborating in teams, receiving feedback, and continuously growing as a developer.
